On the use of complementary fractals or fractal curves as a computational basis suggested by Onri:
Based on the representation of fractal curves, which are commonly thought to fill up space, one can use the complementary component as a way to define a unique representation of information that in itself avoids self similarity. At the very least, the information in it may be thought of as psuedo random. However, since the formation of such a geometry can be computed on both classical and quantum computing resources, then it may have the potential to utilize the randomness of the computational logic.
